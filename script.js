Stuck sa what could've beens and what if and what should've been sa atong relationship. 
I don't think I can find someone better or someone who I can love the way I loved you hart. 
You bring a piece of me nga pangitaon sa uban. 
I love you and I miss you, sa damgo magunitan taka usab and maka uban sakit siya pero thats the only time I can feel you. 
I'd rather feel that pain, that delusion, than not feeling anything from you ever again. 
I don't wanna miss the chance. And I hope I can still see you and talk to you again. 
I miss you very much.`;
